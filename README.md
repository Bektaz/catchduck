# catchduck
This repository was created to host the game called CatchDuck. I have been learning technologies related to Web Development like HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery and etc. intensively, 
so as a result of the knowledge I have gained so far I decided to publish this project.
At the moment the project is about front end development and created for acquaintance purpose with me and with my skills.
